test7: Adam optimizer, alpha=0.01, beta1=0.8, beta2=0.999. Number of levels = number of points. Data badly truncated.
test8: ID301XR1000Oct 10 runs. Same optimizer params as test7.
test9: Accuracy vs nonlinearity parameter, 0 to 1 with 0.1 steps and 1 to 9 with unit steps. 3 runs.
test10: Accuravy vs number of LTP and LTD levels.
test11: Adam optimizer, same parameters as test7, 30 LTP and LTD levels for all devices. Data properly truncated.
test12: Accuracy vs number of levels (numLTP=numLTD, 5 to 20 with steps of 5) and SGD learning rate (0.25 to 1 with 0.25 step).
test13: Accuracy vs min/max conductance. ID294YR 2024.09.19 11:21:56 as reference. Adam optimizer with previous parameters.
test14: Same as test13, max conductance range from 1e-11 to 1e-10 with 1e-11 steps.
test15: aihwkit noise test. Tests done on ID301XR1000Oct 2024.09.19 14:41:43.
test16: aihwkit on all analyzed data. Noise values: default
test17: same as test16, but with SGD instead of ttv2
test18: like test16 but with more noise: { dw_min_dtod = 0.5, dw_min_std = 1.0, }
test19: aihwkit ttv2 with varying noises: { 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9, 2.1 } for dw_min_dtod or dw_min_std while keeping the other at 0.3
test20: mixed precision with SGD on 'pulsedAmplitudeSweep_DCIV[LBE247_ID301XR1000Oct(1)]20240919144143' with varying each noise parameter while keeping the others constant (at default)
